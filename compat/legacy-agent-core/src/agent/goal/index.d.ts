/**
 * Lifecycle status of a goal — deliberately minimal. The durable record only
 * ever holds `active`, `paused`, or `blocked`; `complete` is transient
 * (announce-then-clear) and never rests on disk. There is exactly one running
 * state, two resumable "stopped" states, and one success outcome:
 *
 * | Status     | Persisted | Resumable | Set by                          | Meaning                                          |
 * |------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
 * | `active`   | yes       | (running) | createGoal / resumeGoal         | The goal driver may run continuation turns.      |
 * | `paused`   | yes       | yes       | pauseGoal / pauseActiveGoal /   | User, interrupt, resume, or retryable runtime    |
 * |            |           |           | pauseOnInterrupt /              | stop parked it; intact.                          |
 * |            |           |           | normalizeAfterReplay            |                                                  |
 * | `blocked`  | yes       | yes       | markBlocked                     | The system stopped it for some `reason`.         |
 * | `complete` | no        | —         | markComplete                    | Success — announced in a message, then cleared.  |
 *
 * Only an `active` goal advances: accounting and continuation turns all gate on
 * `status === 'active'`. `paused` and `blocked` are the same kind of
 * thing — "the driver is not running continuation turns, but the goal is intact
 * and resumable via `/goal resume`" — differing only in *who* stopped it (the
 * user vs the system) and the human-readable `reason`. There is no separate
 * `impossible`, `budget_limited`, `error`, or `cancelled` status: an
 * unachievable goal or an exhausted budget becomes `blocked(+reason)`,
 * runtime/model/provider failures become `paused(+reason)`, and `cancelGoal`
 * discards the record entirely. See {@link GoalMode}
 * for the setters and the per-status notes below.
